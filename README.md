# Namekit

NameKit contains multiple projects, including [NameGuard](./nameguard.md).

## Local Development

You must clone this respository, and install the dependencies using [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) before you can run it locally:

1. `git clone https://github.com/namehash/namekit.git`
2. `cd namekit`
3. `pnpm i`
4. `pnpm dev`

It's recommended you run `pnpm dev` in the root of the repository to start all apps, packages, and internal resources to support local development.

## Testing

Tests are automatically ran when a new Pull Request is opened. You can run them locally using `pnpm test`.

If you're developing locally, you can watch changes and run tests automatically using `pnpm test:watch`.

## Continuous Deployment

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage our releases.

1. Run `pnpm changeset`
2. Choose the packages you want to release
3. Add a summary of the changes
4. Commit the file
5. Open a Pull Request
6. Once the PR is merged, a new or existing `Version Packages` PR will open.
7. Merge the `Version Packages` PR when you're ready to release a new version (of all packages) to NPM, or wait to merge in other changesets first.

## Storybook

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.namekit.io/) to preview components across our core packages:

- `@namehash/namekit-react`
- `@namehash/nameguard-react`
- `@namehash/ens-webfont`
- `@namehash/ui`
  - These components are mostly internal and not intended for public use, but they are used across our packages.
